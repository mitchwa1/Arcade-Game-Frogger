Mitch's "Frogger" Arcade Game
===============================
Game Instructions:

1.  The goal of the game is to increase your score, while not losing all your lives

2.  You increase your score by 1 point by moving the character to the water terrain and/or collect Gems.

3.  Every increase of a score of '5' will increase difficulty (more enemies will appear and go faster).

4.  If you collide with any enemies, you will lose a life.

5.  If you move off the screen to the right or bottom of the screen, your player will reset at start position (no loss of lives or effect to score).

6.  If you lose all your lives before you reach level 50, the game will end.

7.  If you reach a score of 50 without losing all your lives, you are victorious.

Good luck!
